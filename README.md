# TBHAG'S Editor
A Flexible Site Builder using Next JS (experimental) https://tbhag-editor.now.sh/

## What is this?
This is a prototype for a site builder that uses components to deliver any combination of DOM/style variants. These combos constuct a page. In this way, visual *Themeing* can be effectively handled.

## Getting Started
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

## Mobile/Desktop
Mobile and Desktop components + variants are handled separately for extra customization and less complexity.

## DownView
For the user to edit anything, they only need to select/click a part of the page. However, these parts can become unclickable with DOM nesting. DownView makes them clear and clickable without hindering the overall layout.
